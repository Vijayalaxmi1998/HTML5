    <p>
      In a sense, &nbsp; India did create history via Chandrayaan 3 in that it
      was the first country to land on the South Pole of the lunar surface. That
      is something no one has attempted till date. Exactly 20 minutes prior to
      the landing time, ISRO initiated its
      <strong
        ><u><i> Automatic Landing Sequence (ALS)</i></u>
      </strong>
      . This well-tested and iterated process enabled Vikram LM to take charge
      and use its on-board computers and logic to identify a favourable spot.
      Not surprisingly, Chandrayaan 3 had a soft and decisive landing on the
      moon. In a sense, it was a redemption for Dr Sivan, who had seen the
      Chandrayaan 2 mission fail by a whisker in last few minutes of landing.

      <br />Fortunately, the event was managed<br />
      <i>smoothly this time around.</i> &nbsp; The Chandrayaan mission has
      thrown <u>smoothly this time around.</u> terra bytes of data for the
      Indian space scientists to pore over, <br />
      more importantly it will sharpen our understanding of the mysteries of the
      universe. Thanks to legendary scientists like
      <strong>Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Dr Abdul Kalam</strong> , and Dr Satish
      Dhawan; India has a space program that is highly effective and has
      consistently delivered the goods in a very cost effective manner amidst
      the plethora of budgetary constraints.
